## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository is a knowledge base where I document:

- Research on **real-world web vulnerabilities**
- Hands-on analysis of security bugs in web applications
- Blog posts exploring exploitation techniques, defense mechanisms, and interesting case studies
- My personal learning journey in **web security, bug bounty, and ethical hacking**

Whether you're a student, CTF player — I hope this content helps you better understand web application flaws and how to prevent them.

## ✍️ Blog Format

Each blog is organized in a dedicated markdown file under the `/blogs` or `/writeups` folder. Some articles include diagrams, code snippets, payloads, and PoC (Proof-of-Concept) examples.

## 🧠 Goal

> “Understand the flaw, recreate the exploit, and explain it clearly.”

This is a personal initiative to build deep, practical knowledge in offensive security — focused mainly on **web applications**.

---

## 🧪 LAB

> “A space where I build and document labs based on my learning progress and research.”

This section contains **custom labs** I’ve created to reinforce and demonstrate my understanding of various web application vulnerabilities. Each lab is designed as a hands-on environment for testing, breaking, and analyzing flaws in a controlled and ethical setting.

This is a personal initiative to build deep, practical knowledge in **offensive security**, with a primary focus on **web application vulnerabilities**.

### 🔧 Lab Goals

- Simulate real-world vulnerability scenarios
- Explore exploitation techniques and edge cases
- Document both offensive and defensive perspectives
- Learn by doing — not just reading

---

### 📁 Structure

Labs may include:

- Vulnerable source code
- Setup instructions (Docker, local, etc.)
- Writeups and PoC (Proof of Concept)
- Fixes or mitigations when applicable
